										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello</p>
<p>I can not modify any title, logo, and text here. Would you take a look?</p>
<p>And why don&#8217;t you make category feature with the doc?</p>
<p>I got this. I love the tab widget <a href="https://docly.guru/docs/docly-documentation/elements/tab/" rel="nofollow">https://docly.guru/docs/docly-documentation/elements/tab/</a></p>
<p>However, for each new individual doc, I need to build the page again. It takes a lot of time. Is there a solution to copy the existing doc at a new draft as Yoast Duplicate Post does? This plugin does not work on docs <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f641.png" alt="🙁" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>Thanks</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I need help on a few things please for the Rogan WordPress Theme I purchased. The site in reference is whichoneapp.com. Here are the issues I&#8217;m running into:</p>
<p>1. Is there a way, at all, to have the app screenshot that I see on whichoneapp.com show up for the mobile version as well? That&#8217;s a big part of the appeal of the site &#8212; to be able to see the actual screenshot.</p>
<p>2. There&#8217;s a small white line that runs down the right hand side of the website on the desktop version only that I can&#8217;t seem to get rid of. Not sure what to do about it. Any idea?</p>
<p>3. On the <strong>mobile</strong> site, when I hit the menu button, the background of the menu is a dark blue color and I can&#8217;t seem to change it at all. I&#8217;ve tried under Theme Settings &gt; Menu &gt; Menu Background Color <strong>and</strong> Background Color but neither seem to be working. I am able to change the link color etc. on both desktop and mobile but not the background color of the menu.</p>
<p>4. Is there anyway to get rid of the menu items on the 404 page?</p>
<p>Overall, I really like the site, but there are a lot of little bugs and issues that have made a bit furstrating, as well as the fact that some things are editable in very unituitive areas. That being said, I&#8217;m hoping you can help me on the above to help alleviate some of these issues. I look forward to hearing back and thank you for your time!</p>
<p>Kind Regards</p>
